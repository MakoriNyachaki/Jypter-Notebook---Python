    "### Monday: Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "They store information using keys and are much more efficient than Python lists. A dictionary is a collection of unordered data, which is stored in key-value pairs. What is meant by “unordered” is the way it is stored in memory. It is not accessible through an index, rather it is accessed through a key. Lists are known as ordered data collections because each item is assigned a specific location. Dictionaries work like a real-life dictionary, where the key is the word and the values are the definition. Dictionaries are useful for working with large data, mapped data, CSV files, APIs, sending or receiving\n",
