    "## Introduction to Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll learn about the Pandas library and how to work with tabular data structures, web scraping with BeautifulSoup and understanding how to parse data, as well as data visualization libraries like matplotlib. At the end of the week, we’ll use all these libraries together to create a small project that scrapes and analyzes web sites.\n",

    "Imagine you’re a data analyst and you’ve just been handed a set of data that shows the number of accidents for all drivers, their ages, and the size of their engines. You need to figure out a way to display this information so that it tells a story. Normally you would create a graph with x, y, z coordinates; however, that can become complicated, and you don’t have time for\n",

    "###### Virtual Enviroments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python virtual environments are essentially a tool that allows you to keep project dependencies in a separate space from other projects. Most projects in Python need to use modules that are not included by default with Python. Now, you could simply\n",
    "download the modules (or libraries) into your Python folder to use; however, that could cause some issues down the road. Let’s say you’re working on two separate projects, where the first one uses Python version 2.7 and the second project uses Python version 3.5. If you try and use the same syntax for both, you’ll run into several issues. Instead, you would create two separate virtual environments, one for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note When creating a virtual environment, a folder called “venv ” will appear. This is where all the libraries that you download are saved. Simply put, a virtual environment is not much more than a folder that stores other files.\n",

    "Pandas is a flexible data analysis library built within the C language, which is excellent for working with tabular data. It is currently the de facto standard for Python-based data analysis, and fluency in Pandas will do wonders for your productivity and frankly your resume. It is one of the fastest ways of getting from zero to answer. Having been written in C, it has increased speed when performing calculations. The Pandas module is a high performance, highly efficient, and high-level data analysis library. It allows us to work with large sets of data called DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Note\n",
    "NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Built from the C language, it uses multidimensional arrays and can perform calculations at high-rate speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pandas is useful in the folloeing ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data like average, median, max, and min of each column\n",
    "\n",
    "• Finding correlations between columns\n",
    "\n",
    "• Tracking the distribution of one or more columns\n",
    "\n",
    "• Visualizing the data with the help of matplotlib, using plot bars, histograms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cleaning and filtering data, whether it’s missing or incomplete, just by applying a user-defined function (UDF) or built-in function\n",
    "\n",
    "• Transforming tabular data into Python to work with\n",
    "\n",
    "• Exporting the data into a CSV, other file, or database\n",
    "\n",
    "• Feature engineer new columns that can be applied to your analysis"
