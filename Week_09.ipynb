    "\n",
    "##### Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the concept to describe how long an algorithm or program takes to execute. Take a list, for example. As the number of items within the list grows, so does the amount of time it takes to iterate over the list. This is known as O(n), where n represents the number of operations. It’s called Big O Notation because you put a “Big O” in front of\n",
    "the number of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O establishes a worst-case scenario runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient Big O Notation is O(1), also known as constant time. It means that no matter how many items or steps are required, it will always take the same amount of\n",
    "time and generally occurs instantly. If we took the same list of 100 items and accessed an index directly, this would be known as O(1). We would retrieve the value in that index\n",
    "immediately without needing to iterate over the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the least efficient time complexities is O(n∗∗2). This is a representation of a double loop. Our Bubble Sort algorithm that we wrote uses a double for loop and is known as one of the less efficient sorting algorithms in programming; however, it is simple to understand, so it makes for a good introduction into algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we originally covered dictionaries, we went over hashing very briefly. Dictionaries can be accessed in O(1) complexity because of how they are stored in memory. They use hash tables to store the key-value pairs. Before we cover hash tables though, let’s have a quick refresher on the hash function and how to use it:\n",
    "    a, c = 'bo', \"bob\"\n",
    "    b = a\n",
    "    print(hash(a), hash(b), hash(c))\n",
    "    \n",
    "From the preceding code, we would get the same values for a and b and a separate value for the hash of c. Hash functions are used to create an integer representation of a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dictionaries store key-value pairs into memory, they use this concept. A hash table is used to store a hash, a key, and a value. The hash stored is used for when you need to retrieve a given value by the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are helpful data collections for not only keeping information connected but also improving efficiency. Keep this in mind when you’re trying to answer programming questions or making a program faster. Like the information on Big O Notation, this is simply an introduction into hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dictionaries vs Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the true power of a hash table and Python dictionaries, let’s compare it against a list. We’ll write a conditional statement to have Python check for a given item\n",
    "within a dictionary and list, and we’ll time how long each one takes. We’re going to separate the code into two cells. The first cell will generate the dictionary and list with 10\n",
